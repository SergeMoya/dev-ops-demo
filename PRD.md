# DevOps Demo Project: Simulated Device Monitoring with Jenkins/Zuul CI/CD Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates DevOps capabilities relevant to Garmin's embedded systems development environment, with a focus on CI/CD automation using Jenkins and Zuul. The project simulates a simplified version of a device telemetry monitoring system that could be used for fitness trackers or GPS devices.

## Business Requirements
- Create a demonstration of CI/CD capabilities for embedded device software development
- Showcase automation skills using Python and shell scripting
- Demonstrate containerization with Docker
- Implement proper Git workflows and code management
- Set up monitoring and alerting for the CI/CD pipeline
- Complete the project within a 5-hour timeframe

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Python Simulation Service
- Python application that simulates device telemetry data (heart rate, GPS coordinates, steps)
- RESTful API using Flask to serve the simulated data
- Unit tests for the simulation logic
- Configuration for different simulated device types

### 2. Visualization Dashboard
- Simple web frontend using React.js
- Real-time data visualization of device metrics
- Basic user interface for controlling simulation parameters
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and Zuul
- Jenkins server setup with necessary plugins
- Zuul configuration for code review and gating
- Automated build pipeline with the following stages:
  - Code checkout
  - Dependency installation
  - Unit testing
  - Code quality analysis
  - Docker image building
  - Deployment to staging environment
- Webhook integration with Git repository

### 4. Containerization
- Docker containers for all components (Python service, web frontend, databases)
- Docker Compose for local development environment
- Container orchestration for deployment
- Optimized Dockerfiles following best practices

### 5. Monitoring and Logging
- Basic monitoring of application health
- Pipeline execution metrics
- Build success/failure notifications
- Performance metrics collection

### 6. Documentation
- Setup instructions for the entire system
- Architecture diagrams
- CI/CD pipeline explanation
- DevOps principles applied in the project

## Implementation Timeline (5 hours)

### Hour 1: Setup and Python Service
- Initialize Git repository with proper branching strategy
- Create Python simulation service with basic functionality
- Implement unit tests for the service

### Hour 2: Frontend and Docker Setup
- Create basic React dashboard
- Set up Dockerfiles for all components
- Configure Docker Compose for local development

### Hour 3: Jenkins and Zuul Configuration
- Set up Jenkins server (local or cloud-based)
- Configure Zuul integration
- Create initial pipeline configuration
- Set up webhooks for automated triggers

### Hour 4: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- Implement complete CI/CD pipeline stages
- Configure automated testing in the pipeline
- Set up Docker image building and publishing
- Implement deployment automation

### Hour 5: Monitoring and Documentation
- Add basic monitoring for the application and pipeline
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Prepare demonstration script
- Final testing and verification

## Success Criteria
- Functional Python simulation service generating device-like telemetry
- Working visualization dashboard displaying the data
- Complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Zuul
- Successful automated build, test, and deployment process
- Containerized application components
- Comprehensive documentation explaining the DevOps approach

## Demonstration Plan
During the interview, demonstrate:
1. The working application (simulation service and dashboard)
2. A code change triggering the CI/CD pipeline
3. The automated testing, building, and deployment process
4. Monitoring and logging capabilities
5. Explanation of DevOps principles applied and how they relate to Garmin's embedded systems development

## Future Enhancements (Beyond 5-hour scope)
- Integration with Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Advanced monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus
- Automated scaling based on load
- Multi-environment deployment (dev, staging, production)
- Infrastructure as Code using Ansible or Terraform
